# Algorithms Catalog
Implementation of different algorithms, my plan is to cover as many algorithms as possible, with an initial focus on dynamic programming, divide and conquer, and graph algorithms. I may add more as I study further, eventually, this should be my 'preferred' implementations repository for any algorithm that interests me either from study or from work and not meant to be a comprehensive catalog.
