# Algorithms Catalog
Implementation of different algorithms, my plan is to cover as much algorithms as possible, with initial focus on dynamic programming, divide and conqure and graph algorithms.
I may add more as I study further, eventually this should be my 'preferred' implementations repository for any 
algorithm that interests me either from study or from work and not meant to be a comprehensive catalog.
